Website made using the php framework Laravel (Build v8.8.0) as well as Tailwindcss.

Hi, I'm Djillali.

I'm a full stack Developer and I build websites ... This website is only used to promotemy services.

The website consists of a music library where albums are searchable. Once you register an account you will have access to a full administration panel. From there you can configure everything related to the music library, (albums, artists, tracks, performers ect). You will also be able to export different pieces of the database into .json files that can be imported at a later date in order to restore the database. On top of being able to add all the information related to an album manually from the administration panel you will also be able to import albums directly from the Discogs api.

The website also consists of a gif organizer where users can save their favourite gifs and organize them into different categories for quick access when needed.

Feel free to contact me regarding any projects or if you have any questions via the contact page on the website or via Github
